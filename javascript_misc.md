#### What is 'currying'?

Currying is when you break down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that take part of the arguments.
```
function add (a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

add(3, 4); returns 7
```
This is a function that takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their sum. We will now curry this function:
```
function add (a) {
  return function (b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}
```
This is a function that takes one argument, a, and returns a function that takes another argument, b, and that function returns their sum.
```
add(3)(4);

var add3 = add(3);

add3(4);
```
The first statement returns 7, like the add(3, 4) statement. The second statement defines a new function called add3 that will add 3 to its argument. This is what some people may call a closure. The third statement uses the add3 operation to add 3 to 4, again producing 7 as a result.
